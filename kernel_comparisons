Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more
beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
per second.

Paravirtualized spinlocks allow a pvops backend to replace the
spinlock implementation with something virtualization-friendly
(for example, block the virtual CPU rather than spinning).

Unfortunately the downside is an up to 5% performance hit on
native kernels, with various workloads.

If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 512 and the
minimum value which makes sense is 2.

This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel image.

This enables chipset and/or board specific fixups to be done
in order to get reboot to work correctly. This is only needed on
some combinations of hardware and BIOS. The symptom, for which
this config is intended, is when reboot ends with a stalled/hung
system.

Currently, the only fixup is for the Geode machines using
CS5530A and CS5536 chipsets and the RDC R-321x SoC.

Say Y if you want to enable the fixup. Currently, it's safe to

If you say Y here, you will be able to update the microcode on
certain Intel and AMD processors. The Intel support is for the
IA32 family, e.g. Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4,
Xeon etc. The AMD support is for families 0x10 and later. You will
obviously need the actual microcode binary data itself which is not
shipped with the Linux kernel.

This option selects the general module only, you need to select
at least one vendor specific module as well.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
will be called microcode.

This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected
from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages
can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.

For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space
a value of 65536 is reasonable and should cause no problems.
On arm and other archs it should not be higher than 32768.
Programs which use vm86 functionality or have some need to map
this low address space will need CAP_SYS_RAWIO or disable this
protection by setting the value to 0.

This value can be changed after boot using the
/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr tunable.

Transparent Hugepages allows the kernel to use huge pages and
huge tlb transparently to the applications whenever possible.
This feature can improve computing performance to certain
applications by speeding up page faults during memory
allocation, by reducing the number of tlb misses and by speeding
up the pagetable walking.

If memory constrained on embedded, you may want to say N.

Cleancache can be thought of as a page-granularity victim cache
for clean pages that the kernel's pageframe replacement algorithm
(PFRA) would like to keep around, but can't since there isn't enough
memory.  So when the PFRA "evicts" a page, it first attempts to use
cleancache code to put the data contained in that page into
"transcendent memory", memory that is not directly accessible or
addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly
time-varying size.  And when a cleancache-enabled
filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first
checks cleancache to see if it already contains it; if it does,
the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided.
When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or
Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction
may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls
are reduced to a single pointer-compare-against-NULL resulting
in a negligible performance hit.

If unsure, say Y to enable cleancache

Frontswap is so named because it can be thought of as the opposite
of a "backing" store for a swap device.  The data is stored into
"transcendent memory", memory that is not directly accessible or
addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly
time-varying size.  When space in transcendent memory is available,
a significant swap I/O reduction may be achieved.  When none is
available, all frontswap calls are reduced to a single pointer-
compare-against-NULL resulting in a negligible performance hit
and swap data is stored as normal on the matching swap device.

If unsure, say Y to enable frontswap.

Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
coprocessor or this emulation.

If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel
command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
intend to use this kernel on different machines.

More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
emulation can be found in <file:arch/x86/math-emu/README>.

If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
kernel, it won't hurt.

This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled
and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
defined by each seccomp mode.

If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
address.

In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
(CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
(normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump,
leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux
for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of
the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on
the "X" value as specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM"
command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed
kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
for more details about crash dumps.

Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
is present because there are users out there who continue to use
vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
line.

Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

This value puts the alignment restrictions on physical address
where kernel is loaded and run from. Kernel is compiled for an
address which meets above alignment restriction.

If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set, kernel will move itself to nearest
address aligned to above value and run from there.

If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time
load address and decompress itself to the address it has been
compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is
compiled already meets above alignment restrictions. Hence the
end result is that kernel runs from a physical address meeting
above alignment restrictions.

Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for 
Linux requires an ACPI-compliant platform (hardware/firmware),
and assumes the presence of OS-directed configuration and power
management (OSPM) software.  This option will enlarge your 
kernel by about 70K.

Linux ACPI provides a robust functional replacement for several 
legacy configuration and power management interfaces, including
the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP BIOS), the 
MultiProcessor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced Power 
Management (APM) specification.  If both ACPI and APM support 
are configured, ACPI is used.

The project home page for the Linux ACPI subsystem is here:
<http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/>

Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
Component Architecture (ACPI CA).  For more information on the
ACPI CA, see:
<http://acpica.org/>

ACPI is an open industry specification co-developed by
Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba.

Say N to disable Embedded Controller /sys/kernel/debug interface

Be aware that using this interface can confuse your Embedded
Controller in a way that a normal reboot is not enough. You then
have to power off your system, and remove the laptop battery for
some seconds.
An Embedded Controller typically is available on laptops and reads
sensor values like battery state and temperature.
The kernel accesses the EC through ACPI parsed code provided by BIOS
tables. This option allows to access the EC directly without ACPI
code being involved.
Thus this option is a debug option that helps to write ACPI drivers
and can be used to identify ACPI code or EC firmware bugs.

A user-space daemon, acpid, typically reads /proc/acpi/event
and handles all ACPI-generated events.

These events are now delivered to user-space either
via the input layer or as netlink events.

This build option enables the old code for legacy
user-space implementation.  After some time, this will
be moved under CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS, and then deleted.

Say Y here to retain the old behaviour.  Say N if your
user-space is newer than kernel 2.6.23 (September 2007).

CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
(see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

state L0/L0s/L1.

ASPM is initially set up by the firmware. With this option enabled,
Linux can modify this state in order to disable ASPM on known-bad
hardware or configurations and enable it when known-safe.

ASPM can be disabled or enabled at runtime via
/sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

encapsulating protocol. This particular tunneling driver implements
GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) and at this time allows
encapsulating of IPv4 or IPv6 over existing IPv6 infrastructure.
This driver is useful if the other endpoint is a Cisco router: Cisco
likes GRE much better than the other Linux tunneling driver ("IP
tunneling" above). In addition, GRE allows multicast redistribution
through the tunnel.

Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
that pass through your Linux box.

The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
you say Y here.

You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
called NAT (Network Address Translation).

Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
typically a caching proxy server.

Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
configuration).

Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
<file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
these packages.

Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
into connections.

There is a commonly-used extension to IRC called
Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC).  This enables users to send
files to each other, and also chat to each other without the need
of a server.  DCC Sending is used anywhere you send files over IRC,
and DCC Chat is most commonly used by Eggdrop bots.  If you are
using NAT, this extension will enable you to send files and initiate
chats.  Note that you do NOT need this extension to get files or
have others initiate chats, or everything else in IRC.

NetBIOS name service requests are sent as broadcast messages from an
unprivileged port and responded to with unicast messages to the
same port. This make them hard to firewall properly because connection
tracking doesn't deal with broadcasts. This helper tracks locally
originating NetBIOS name service requests and the corresponding
responses. It relies on correct IP address configuration, specifically
netmask and broadcast address. When properly configured, the output
of "ip address show" should look similar to this:

$ ip -4 address show eth0

Protocol, RFC2637) connection tracking and NAT.

If you are running PPTP sessions over a stateful firewall or NAT
box, you may want to enable this feature.

Please note that not all PPTP modes of operation are supported yet.
Specifically these limitations exist:
  - Blindly assumes that control connections are always established
    in PNS->PAC direction. This is a violation of RFC2637.
  - Only supports a single call within each session

table.

You can use this target to compute and fill in the checksum in
a packet that lacks a checksum.  This is particularly useful,
if you need to work around old applications such as dhcp clients,
that do not work well with checksum offloads, but don't want to disable
checksum offload in your device.

This option adds a `DSCP' target, which allows you to manipulate
the IPv4/IPv6 header DSCP field (differentiated services codepoint).

The DSCP field can have any value between 0x0 and 0x3f inclusive.

It also adds the "TOS" target, which allows you to create rules in
the "mangle" table which alter the Type Of Service field of an IPv4
or the Priority field of an IPv6 packet, prior to routing.

To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

This option adds the "HMARK" target.

The target allows you to create rules in the "raw" and "mangle" tables
which set the skbuff mark by means of hash calculation within a given
range. The nfmark can influence the routing method (see "Use netfilter
MARK value as routing key") and can also be used by other subsystems to
change their behaviour.

This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
minus 40).

This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
packets:
      1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
      2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
      3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
configuration like:

iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN                     -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

This option allows you to build work-load-sharing clusters of
network servers/stateful firewalls without having a dedicated
load-balancing router/server/switch. Basically, this match returns
true when the packet must be handled by this cluster node. Thus,
all nodes see all packets and this match decides which node handles
what packets. The work-load sharing algorithm is based on source
address hashing.

If you say Y or M here, try `iptables -m cluster --help` for
more information.

IP Virtual Server support will let you build a high-performance
virtual server based on cluster of two or more real servers. This
option must be enabled for at least one of the clustered computers
that will take care of intercepting incoming connections to a
single IP address and scheduling them to real servers.

Three request dispatching techniques are implemented, they are
virtual server via NAT, virtual server via tunneling and virtual
server via direct routing. The several scheduling algorithms can
be used to choose which server the connection is directed to,
thus load balancing can be achieved among the servers.  For more
information and its administration program, please visit the
following URL: <http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/>.

The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle
hash collisions. Using a big IPVS connection hash table will greatly
reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
in the hash table.

Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
size 32768 (2**15).

Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
needed for your box.

You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter
or by appending ip_vs.conn_tab_bits=? to the kernel command line
if IP VS was compiled built-in.

The locality-based least-connection scheduling algorithm is for
destination IP load balancing. It is usually used in cache cluster.
This algorithm usually directs packet destined for an IP address to
its server if the server is alive and under load. If the server is

and there is a server in its half load, then allocate the weighted
least-connection server to this IP address.

The locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling
algorithm is also for destination IP load balancing. It is 
usually used in cache cluster. It differs from the LBLC scheduling
as follows: the load balancer maintains mappings from a target
to a set of server nodes that can serve the target. Requests for
a target are assigned to the least-connection node in the target's
server set. If all the node in the server set are over loaded,
it picks up a least-connection node in the cluster and adds it
in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not been
modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed
from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.

Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (RFC 4340)

From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4340.txt:

The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport
protocol that implements bidirectional, unicast connections of
congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams. It should be suitable
for use by applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony,
and on-line games.

To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called dccp.

CCID-3 denotes TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), an equation-based
rate-controlled congestion control mechanism.  TFRC is designed to
be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP-like flows,
where a flow is "reasonably fair" if its sending rate is generally
within a factor of two of the sending rate of a TCP flow under the
same conditions.  However, TFRC has a much lower variation of
throughput over time compared with TCP, which makes CCID-3 more
suitable than CCID-2 for applications such streaming media where a
relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.

CCID-3 is further described in RFC 4342,
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4342.txt

The TFRC congestion control algorithms were initially described in
RFC 5348.

ATM is a high-speed networking technology for Local Area Networks
and Wide Area Networks.  It uses a fixed packet size and is
connection oriented, allowing for the negotiation of minimum
bandwidth requirements.

In order to participate in an ATM network, your Linux box needs an
ATM networking card. If you have that, say Y here and to the driver
of your ATM card below.

Note that you need a set of user-space programs to actually make use
of ATM.  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/atm.txt> for
further details.

Layer Two Tunneling Protocol

From RFC 2661 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2661.txt>.

L2TP facilitates the tunneling of packets across an
intervening network in a way that is as transparent as
possible to both end-users and applications.

L2TP is often used to tunnel PPP traffic over IP
tunnels. One IP tunnel may carry thousands of individual PPP
connections. L2TP is also used as a VPN protocol, popular
with home workers to connect to their offices.

L2TPv3 allows other protocols as well as PPP to be carried
over L2TP tunnels. L2TPv3 is defined in RFC 3931
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3931.txt>.

The kernel component handles only L2TP data packets: a
userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol (tunnel
and session setup). One such daemon is OpenL2TP
(http://openl2tp.org/).

If you don't need L2TP, say N. To compile all L2TP code as
modules, choose M here.

Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 3

From RFC 3931 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3931.txt>.

The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a dynamic
mechanism for tunneling Layer 2 (L2) "circuits" across a
packet-oriented data network (e.g., over IP).  L2TP, as
originally defined in RFC 2661, is a standard method for
tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] sessions.
L2TP has since been adopted for tunneling a number of other
L2 protocols, including ATM, Frame Relay, HDLC and even raw
ethernet frames.

If you are connecting to L2TPv3 equipment, or you want to
tunnel raw ethernet frames using L2TP, say Y here. If
unsure, say N.

Support for L2TP-over-IP socket family.

The L2TPv3 protocol defines two possible encapsulations for
L2TP frames, namely UDP and plain IP (without UDP). This
driver provides a new L2TPIP socket family with which
userspace L2TPv3 daemons may create L2TP/IP tunnel sockets
when UDP encapsulation is not required. When L2TP is carried
in IP packets, it used IP protocol number 115, so this port
must be enabled in firewalls.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
will be called l2tp_ip.

The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3 (L2TPv3) can be
used as a control protocol and for data encapsulation to set
up Pseudowires for transporting layer 2 Packet Data Units
across an IP network [RFC3931].

This driver provides an ethernet virtual interface for each
L2TP ethernet pseudowire instance. Standard Linux tools may
be used to assign an IP address to the local virtual
interface, or add the interface to a bridge.

If you are using L2TPv3, you will almost certainly want to
enable this option.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
will be called l2tp_eth.

If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an
Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it
is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants.
Several such bridges can work together to create even larger
networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm.
As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with
other third party bridge products.

In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge
configuration tools; see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt>
for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more
information.

If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you
turn your bridge into a bridging IP firewall.
iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to
take this into account when setting up your firewall rules.
Enabling arptables support when bridging will let arptables see
bridged ARP traffic in the arptables FORWARD chain.

To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module
will be called bridge.

receive and forward traffic based on VLAN information in the packet
any VLAN information configured on the bridge port or bridge device.

Say N to exclude this support and reduce the binary size.

If unsure, say Y.

everything a regular ethernet interface does, including
firewalling, bridging, and of course IP traffic.  You will need
the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in order to effectively
use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more information:

The DECnet networking protocol was used in many products made by
Digital (now Compaq).  It provides reliable stream and sequenced
packet communications over which run a variety of services similar
to those which run over TCP/IP.

To find some tools to use with the kernel layer support, please
look at Patrick Caulfield's web site:
<http://linux-decnet.sourceforge.net/>.

More detailed documentation is available in
<file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt>.

Be sure to say Y to "/proc file system support" and "Sysctl support"
below when using DECnet, since you will need sysctl support to aid
in configuration at run time.

The DECnet code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
The module is called decnet.

Add support for turning your DECnet Endnode into a level 1 or 2
router.  This is an experimental, but functional option.  If you
do say Y here, then make sure that you also say Y to "Kernel/User
network link driver", "Routing messages" and "Network packet
filtering".  The first two are required to allow configuration via
rtnetlink (you will need Alexey Kuznetsov's iproute2 package
from <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>). The "Network packet
filtering" option will be required for the forthcoming routing daemon
to work.

This is support for the Novell networking protocol, IPX, commonly
used for local networks of Windows machines.  You need it if you
want to access Novell NetWare file or print servers using the Linux
Novell client ncpfs (available from
<ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/>) or from
within the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO,
available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>).  In order
to do the former, you'll also have to say Y to "NCP file system
support", below.

IPX is similar in scope to IP, while SPX, which runs on top of IPX,
is similar to TCP.

To turn your Linux box into a fully featured NetWare file server and
IPX router, say Y here and fetch either lwared from
<ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons/> or
mars_nwe from <ftp://www.compu-art.de/mars_nwe/>. For more
information, read the IPX-HOWTO available from
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

The IPX driver would enlarge your kernel by about 16 KB. To compile
this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called ipx.
Unless you want to integrate your Linux box with a local Novell
network, say N.

AppleTalk is the protocol that Apple computers can use to communicate
on a network.  If your Linux box is connected to such a network and you
wish to connect to it, say Y.  You will need to use the netatalk package
so that your Linux box can act as a print and file server for Macs as
well as access AppleTalk printers.  Check out
<http://www.zettabyte.net/netatalk/> on the WWW for details.
EtherTalk is the name used for AppleTalk over Ethernet and the
cheaper and slower LocalTalk is AppleTalk over a proprietary Apple
network using serial links.  EtherTalk and LocalTalk are fully
supported by Linux.

General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.  The
NET3-4-HOWTO, available from
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
information as well.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
called appletalk. You almost certainly want to compile it as a
module so you can restart your AppleTalk stack without rebooting
your machine. I hear that the GNU boycott of Apple is over, so
even politically correct people are allowed to say Y here.

This allows IP networking for users who only have AppleTalk
networking available. This feature is experimental. With this
driver, you can encapsulate IP inside AppleTalk (e.g. if your Linux
box is stuck on an AppleTalk only network) or decapsulate (e.g. if
you want your Linux box to act as an Internet gateway for a zoo of
AppleTalk connected Macs). Please see the file
<file:Documentation/networking/ipddp.txt> for more information.

If you say Y here, the AppleTalk-IP support will be compiled into
the kernel. In this case, you can either use encapsulation or
decapsulation, but not both. With the following two questions, you
decide which one you want.

To compile the AppleTalk-IP support as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called ipddp.
In this case, you will be able to use both encapsulation and
decapsulation simultaneously, by loading two copies of the module
and specifying different values for the module option ipddp_mode.

X.25 is a set of standardized network protocols, similar in scope to
frame relay; the one physical line from your box to the X.25 network
entry point can carry several logical point-to-point connections
(called "virtual circuits") to other computers connected to the X.25
network. Governments, banks, and other organizations tend to use it
to connect to each other or to form Wide Area Networks (WANs). Many
countries have public X.25 networks. X.25 consists of two
protocols: the higher level Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) (say Y here
if you want that) and the lower level data link layer protocol LAPB
(say Y to "LAPB Data Link Driver" below if you want that).

You can read more about X.25 at <http://www.sangoma.com/x25.htm> and
<http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios11/cbook/cx25.htm>.
Information about X.25 for Linux is contained in the files
<file:Documentation/networking/x25.txt> and
<file:Documentation/networking/x25-iface.txt>.

One connects to an X.25 network either with a dedicated network card
using the X.21 protocol (not yet supported by Linux) or one can do
X.25 over a standard telephone line using an ordinary modem (say Y
to "X.25 async driver" below) or over Ethernet using an ordinary
Ethernet card and the LAPB over Ethernet (say Y to "LAPB Data Link
Driver" and "LAPB over Ethernet driver" below).

Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) is the data link layer (i.e.
the lower) part of the X.25 protocol. It offers a reliable
connection service to exchange data frames with one other host, and
it is used to transport higher level protocols (mostly X.25 Packet
Layer, the higher part of X.25, but others are possible as well).
Usually, LAPB is used with specialized X.21 network cards, but Linux
currently supports LAPB only over Ethernet connections. If you want
to use LAPB connections over Ethernet, say Y here and to "LAPB over

This queuing discipline allows userspace to plug/unplug a network
output queue, using the netlink interface.  When it receives an
enqueue command it inserts a plug into the outbound queue that
causes following packets to enqueue until a dequeue command arrives
over netlink, causing the plug to be removed and resuming the normal
packet flow.

This module also provides a generic "network output buffering"
functionality (aka output commit), wherein upon arrival of a dequeue
command, only packets up to the first plug are released for delivery.
The Remus HA project uses this module to enable speculative execution
of virtual machines by allowing the generated network output to be rolled
back if needed.

Open vSwitch is a multilayer Ethernet switch targeted at virtualized
environments.  In addition to supporting a variety of features
expected in a traditional hardware switch, it enables fine-grained
programmatic extension and flow-based control of the network.  This
control is useful in a wide variety of applications but is
particularly important in multi-server virtualization deployments,
which are often characterized by highly dynamic endpoints and the
need to maintain logical abstractions for multiple tenants.

The Open vSwitch datapath provides an in-kernel fast path for packet
forwarding.  It is complemented by a userspace daemon, ovs-vswitchd,
which is able to accept configuration from a variety of sources and
translate it into packet processing rules.

See http://openvswitch.org for more information and userspace
utilities.

To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be
called openvswitch.

Bluetooth is low-cost, low-power, short-range wireless technology.
It was designed as a replacement for cables and other short-range
technologies like IrDA.  Bluetooth operates in personal area range
that typically extends up to 10 meters.  More information about
Bluetooth can be found at <http://www.bluetooth.com/>.

Linux Bluetooth subsystem consist of several layers:
   Bluetooth Core
      HCI device and connection manager, scheduler
      SCO audio links
      L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)
      SMP (Security Manager Protocol) on LE (Low Energy) links
   HCI Device drivers (Interface to the hardware)
   RFCOMM Module (RFCOMM Protocol)  
   BNEP Module (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol)
   CMTP Module (CAPI Message Transport Protocol)
   HIDP Module (Human Interface Device Protocol)

Say Y here to compile Bluetooth support into the kernel or say M to
compile it as module (bluetooth).

To use Linux Bluetooth subsystem, you will need several user-space
utilities like hciconfig and bluetoothd.  These utilities and updates
to Bluetooth kernel modules are provided in the BlueZ packages.  For
more information, see <http://www.bluez.org/>.

NOTE: In order to authenticate connections you have to select

DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the
node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device
simply writes the data to its lower level block device.

DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both
nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a
shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary
DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for
cache coherency.

For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).

Saying Y here will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory as
a block device, so that you can make file systems on it, read and
write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal
block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and
store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM
during the initial install of Linux.

Note that the kernel command line option "ramdisk=XX" is now obsolete.

Enable this driver to get read/write support to most I2C EEPROMs
and compatible devices like FRAMs, SRAMs, ROMs etc. After you
configure the driver to know about each chip on your target
board.  Use these generic chip names, instead of vendor-specific
ones like at24c64, 24lc02 or fm24c04:

   24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,
   24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024

Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip
you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a
24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip
as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip
has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the
code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.

If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter,
full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are
supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).

This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
will be called at24.

The OnStream SC-x0 SCSI tape drives cannot be driven by the
standard st driver, but instead need this special osst driver and
use the  /dev/osstX char device nodes (major 206).  Via usb-storage,
you may be able to drive the USB-x0 and DI-x0 drives as well.
Note that there is also a second generation of OnStream
tape drives (ADR-x0) that supports the standard SCSI-2 commands for
tapes (QIC-157) and can be driven by the standard driver st.
For more information, you may have a look at the SCSI-HOWTO
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>  and
<file:Documentation/scsi/osst.txt>  in the kernel source.
More info on the OnStream driver may be found on
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/osst/>
Please also have a look at the standard st docu, as most of it
applies to osst as well.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
<file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>. The module will be called osst.

If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
about anything having "SCSI" in its name other than hard disks,
CD-ROMs or tapes, say Y here. These won't be supported by the kernel
directly, so you need some additional software which knows how to
talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.sane-project.org/>). For CD
writer software look at Cdrtools
(<http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/cdrecord.html>)
and for burning a "disk at once": CDRDAO
(<http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>). Cdparanoia is a high
quality digital reader of audio CDs (<http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/>).
For other devices, it's possible that you'll have to write the
driver software yourself. Please read the file
<file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-generic.txt> for more information.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
<file:Documentation/scsi/scsi.txt>. The module will be called sg.

If unsure, say N.

This is a driver for SCSI media changers.  Most common devices are
tape libraries and MOD/CDROM jukeboxes.  *Real* jukeboxes, you
don't need this for those tiny 6-slot cdrom changers.  Media
changers are listed as "Type: Medium Changer" in /proc/scsi/scsi.
If you have such hardware and want to use it with linux, say Y
here.  Check <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-changer.txt> for details.

Some devices support more than one LUN (Logical Unit Number) in order
to allow access to several media, e.g. CD jukebox, USB card reader,
mobile phone in mass storage mode. This option forces the kernel to
probe for all LUNs by default. This setting can be overriden by
max_luns boot/module parameter. Note that this option does not affect
devices conforming to SCSI-3 or higher as they can explicitely report
their number of LUNs. It is safe to say Y here unless you have one of
those rare devices which reacts in an unexpected way when probed for
multiple LUNs.

The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the
system continues booting, and even probe devices on different
busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.

If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
will work fine if you say Y here.

You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
or async on the kernel's command line.

The iSCSI Driver provides a host with the ability to access storage
through an IP network. The driver uses the iSCSI protocol to transport
SCSI requests and responses over a TCP/IP network between the host
(the "initiator") and "targets".  Architecturally, the iSCSI driver
combines with the host's TCP/IP stack, network drivers, and Network
Interface Card (NIC) to provide the same functions as a SCSI or a
Fibre Channel (FC) adapter driver with a Host Bus Adapter (HBA).

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called iscsi_tcp.

The userspace component needed to initialize the driver, documentation,
and sample configuration files can be found here:

WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer
under active development.  Adaptec, Inc. is writing a new driver to
take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI
controllers. These include the 274x EISA cards; 284x VLB cards;
2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically
not supported (that's the RAID controller chip on the AAA-13x
cards).

Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this
driver; choose "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" instead if you have
one of those.

Information on the configuration options for this controller can be
found by checking the help file for each of the available
configuration options. You should read
<file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx_old.txt> at a minimum before
contacting the maintainer with any questions.  The SCSI-HOWTO,
available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, can also
be of great help.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called aic7xxx_old.

This specifies how many SCSI commands can be maximally queued for
each probed SCSI device. You should reduce the default value of 16
only if you have disks with buggy or limited tagged command support.
Minimum is 2 and maximum is 62. This value is also the window size
used by the elevator sorting option above. The effective value used
by the driver for each probed SCSI device is reported at boot time.
This is equivalent to the "eata=mq:8" boot option.

This option only applies to PCI-SCSI chips that are PCI DAC
capable (875A, 895A, 896, 1010-33, 1010-66, 1000).

When set to 0, the driver will program the chip to only perform
32-bit DMA.  When set to 1, the chip will be able to perform DMA
to addresses up to 1TB.  When set to 2, the driver supports the
full 64-bit DMA address range, but can only address 16 segments
of 4 GB each.  This limits the total addressable range to 64 GB.

Most machines with less than 4GB of memory should use a setting
of 0 for best performance.  If your machine has 4GB of memory
or more, you should set this option to 1 (the default).

The still experimental value 2 (64 bit DMA addressing with 16
x 4GB segments limitation) can be used on systems that require
PCI address bits past bit 39 to be set for the addressing of
memory using PCI DAC cycles.

This is a host adapter simulator that can simulate multiple hosts
each with multiple dummy SCSI devices (disks). It defaults to one
host adapter with one dummy SCSI disk. Each dummy disk uses kernel
RAM as storage (i.e. it is a ramdisk). To save space when multiple
dummy disks are simulated, they share the same kernel RAM for 
their storage. See <http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sdebug26.html> for more
information. This driver is primarily of use to those testing the
SCSI and block subsystems. If unsure, say N.

This option adds support for ATA controllers with SFF
compliant or similar programming interface.

SFF is the legacy IDE interface that has been around since
the dawn of time.  Almost all PATA controllers have an
SFF interface.  Many SATA controllers have an SFF interface
when configured into a legacy compatibility mode.

For users with exclusively modern controllers like AHCI,
Silicon Image 3124, or Marvell 6440, you may choose to
disable this unneeded SFF support.

This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of
the partitions is done by the kernel. "Hardware RAID" means that the
combining is done by a dedicated controller; if you have such a
controller, you do not need to say Y here.

A RAID-1 set consists of several disk drives which are exact copies
of each other.  In the event of a mirror failure, the RAID driver
will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing
an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the
kernel.  In a set with N drives, the available space is the capacity
of a single drive, and the set protects against a failure of (N - 1)
drives.

RAID-10 provides a combination of striping (RAID-0) and
mirroring (RAID-1) with easier configuration and more flexible
layout.
Unlike RAID-0, but like RAID-1, RAID-10 requires all devices to
be the same size (or at least, only as much as the smallest device
will be used).
RAID-10 provides a variety of layouts that provide different levels
of redundancy and performance.

RAID-10 requires mdadm-1.7.0 or later, available at:

A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive provides
the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
of a single drive. For a given sector (row) number, (N - 1) drives
contain data sectors, and one drive contains the parity protection.
For a RAID-4 set, the parity blocks are present on a single drive,
while a RAID-5 set distributes the parity across the drives in one
of the available parity distribution methods.

A RAID-6 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive
provides the capacity of C * (N - 2) MB, and protects
against a failure of any two drives. For a given sector
(row) number, (N - 2) drives contain data sectors, and two
drives contains two independent redundancy syndromes.  Like
RAID-5, RAID-6 distributes the syndromes across the drives
in one of the available parity distribution methods.

The Fusion MPT misc device driver provides specialized control
of MPT adapters via system ioctl calls.  Use of ioctl calls to
the MPT driver requires that you create and use a misc device
node ala:
mknod /dev/mptctl c 10 240

One use of this ioctl interface is to perform an upgrade (reflash)
of the MPT adapter firmware.  Refer to readme file(s) distributed
with the Fusion MPT linux driver for additional details.

If enabled by saying M to this, a driver named: mptctl
will be compiled.

If unsure whether you really want or need this, say N.

Nosy is an IEEE 1394 packet sniffer that is used for protocol
analysis and in development of IEEE 1394 drivers, applications,
or firmwares.

This driver lets you use a Texas Instruments PCILynx 1394 to PCI
link layer controller TSB12LV21/A/B as a low-budget bus analyzer.
PCILynx is a nowadays very rare IEEE 1394 controller which is
not OHCI 1394 compliant.

The following cards are known to be based on PCILynx or PCILynx-2:
IOI IOI-1394TT (PCI card), Unibrain Fireboard 400 PCI Lynx-2
(PCI card), Newer Technology FireWire 2 Go (CardBus card),
Apple Power Mac G3 blue & white and G4 with PCI graphics
(onboard controller).

To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be
called nosy.  Source code of a userspace interface to nosy, called
nosy-dump, can be found in tools/firewire/ of the kernel sources.

The Intelligent Input/Output (I2O) architecture allows hardware
drivers to be split into two parts: an operating system specific
module called the OSM and an hardware specific module called the
HDM. The OSM can talk to a whole range of HDM's, and ideally the
HDM's are not OS dependent. This allows for the same HDM driver to
be used under different operating systems if the relevant OSM is in
place. In order for this to work, you need to have an I2O interface
adapter card in your computer. This card contains a special I/O
processor (IOP), thus allowing high speeds since the CPU does not
have to deal with I/O.

If you say Y here, you will get a choice of interface adapter
drivers and OSM's with the following questions.

To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the
modules will be called i2o_core.

This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
provided by your regular phone modem.

At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
you have this card. The module will be called sb1000. Then read
<file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
found at:

<http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/>
<http://home.adelphia.net/~siglercm/sb1000.html>
<http://linuxpower.cx/~cable/>

If you don't have this card, of course say N.

Locations: ../drivers/net/plip/Kconfig:5

PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a
reasonably fast mini network consisting of two (or, rarely, more)
local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to
install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
enabled for this to work.

The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
<file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP
protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together
with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges
your kernel by about 8 KB.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
will be called plip. If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy
a laptop later.

PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
days support PPP rather than SLIP.

To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
synchronous PPP", below.

If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M
here. The module will be called ppp_generic.

Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
purpose.

Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
around (available from
<ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
NET-3-HOWTO, available from
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
<http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
will be called slip.

This driver supports several kinds of network links over USB,
with "minidrivers" built around a common network driver core
that supports deep queues for efficient transfers.  (This gives
better performance with small packets and at high speeds).

The USB host runs "usbnet", and the other end of the link might be:

- Another USB host, when using USB "network" or "data transfer"
  cables.  These are often used to network laptops to PCs, like
  "Laplink" parallel cables or some motherboards.  These rely
  on specialized chips from many suppliers.

- An intelligent USB gadget, perhaps embedding a Linux system.
  These include PDAs running Linux (iPaq, Yopy, Zaurus, and
  others), and devices that interoperate using the standard
  CDC-Ethernet specification (including many cable modems).

- Network adapter hardware (like those for 10/100 Ethernet) which
  uses this driver framework.

The link will appear with a name like "usb0", when the link is
a two-node link, or "eth0" for most CDC-Ethernet devices.  Those
two-node links are most easily managed with Ethernet Bridging
(CONFIG_BRIDGE) instead of routing.

Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, Frame Relay and leased
lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.

Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
needed to connect to a WAN. As an alternative, a relatively
inexpensive WAN interface card can allow your Linux box to directly
connect to a WAN.

If you have one of those cards and wish to use it under Linux,
say Y here and also to the WAN driver for your card.

If unsure, say N.

This driver provides support for Xen paravirtual network
devices exported by a Xen network driver domain (often
domain 0).

The corresponding Linux backend driver is enabled by the
CONFIG_XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND option.

If you are compiling a kernel for use as Xen guest, you
should say Y here. To compile this driver as a module, chose
M here: the module will be called xen-netfront.

This driver allows the kernel to act as a Xen network driver
domain which exports paravirtual network devices to other
Xen domains. These devices can be accessed by any operating
system that implements a compatible front end.

The corresponding Linux frontend driver is enabled by the
CONFIG_XEN_NETDEV_FRONTEND configuration option.

The backend driver presents a standard network device
endpoint for each paravirtual network device to the driver
domain network stack. These can then be bridged or routed
etc in order to provide full network connectivity.

If you are compiling a kernel to run in a Xen network driver
domain (often this is domain 0) you should say Y here. To
compile this driver as a module, chose M here: the module
will be called xen-netback.

ISDN ("Integrated Services Digital Network", called RNIS in France)
is a fully digital telephone service that can be used for voice and
data connections.  If your computer is equipped with an ISDN
adapter you can use it to connect to your Internet service provider
(with SLIP or PPP) faster than via a conventional telephone modem
(though still much slower than with DSL) or to make and accept
voice calls (eg. turning your PC into a software answering machine
or PABX).

Select this option if you want your kernel to support ISDN.

accept kernel parameters in both forms like 8250_core.nr_uarts=4 and
8250.nr_uarts=4. We now renamed the module back to 8250, but if
anybody noticed in 3.7 and changed their userspace we still have to
keep the 8350_core.* options around until they revert the changes
they already did.

If 8250 is built as a module, this adds 8250_core alias instead.

If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
<http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
(e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
corresponding drivers into the kernel.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
<file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
"lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
IDs).

This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).

If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
to be selected.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called nvram.

The ACP modem (Mwave) for Linux is a WinModem. It is composed of a
kernel driver and a user level application. Together these components
support direct attachment to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
and support selected world wide countries.

This version of the ACP Modem driver supports the IBM Thinkpad 600E,
600, and 770 that include on board ACP modem hardware.

The modem also supports the standard communications port interface
(ttySx) and is compatible with the Hayes AT Command Set.

The user level application needed to use this driver can be found at
the IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) web site:
<http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/>.

If you own one of the above IBM Thinkpads which has the Mwave chipset
in it, say Y.

This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

This driver is a replacement for (and was inspired by) an older
driver named i2c-philips-par.  The new driver supports more devices,
and makes it easier to add support for new devices.

An adapter type parameter is now mandatory.  Please read the file
Documentation/i2c/busses/i2c-parport for details.

Another driver exists, named i2c-parport-light, which doesn't depend
on the parport driver.  This is meant for embedded systems. Don't say
Y here if you intend to say Y or M there.

This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
will be called i2c-parport.

This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for
the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
daisy-chain other parallel port devices.

Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
time.

This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
will be called i2c-parport-light.

The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
(half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
work with most such devices and controllers.

PPS (Pulse Per Second) is a special pulse provided by some GPS
antennae. Userland can use it to get a high-precision time
reference.

Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with the CD (Carrier
Detect) pin of the serial line they use to communicate with the
host. In this case use the SERIAL_LINE client support.

Some antennae's PPS signals are connected with some special host
inputs so you have to enable the corresponding client support.

The IEEE 1588 standard defines a method to precisely
synchronize distributed clocks over Ethernet networks. The
standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can
be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen
microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware
time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve
synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.

This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character
devices. If you want to use a PTP clock, then you should
also enable at least one clock driver as well.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
will be called ptp.

clock. The hardware supports time stamping of PTP packets
when using the end-to-end delay (E2E) mechansim. The peer
delay mechansim (P2P) is not supported.

This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are getting
hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets using the
SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

This is mostly useful to work around omissions in a system's
kernel support.  Those are common in custom and semicustom
hardware assembled using standard kernels with a minimum of
custom patches.  In those cases, userspace code may import
a given GPIO from the kernel, if no kernel driver requested it.

Kernel drivers may also request that a particular GPIO be
exported to userspace; this can be useful when debugging.

Say yes here to provide access to most "quasi-bidirectional" I2C
GPIO expanders used for additional digital outputs or inputs.
Most of these parts are from NXP, though TI is a second source for
some of them.  Compatible models include:

8 bits:   pcf8574, pcf8574a, pca8574, pca8574a,
          pca9670, pca9672, pca9674, pca9674a,

16 bits:  pcf8575, pcf8575c, pca8575,
          pca9671, pca9673, pca9675

Your board setup code will need to declare the expanders in
use, and assign numbers to the GPIOs they expose.  Those GPIOs
can then be used from drivers and other kernel code, just like
other GPIOs, but only accessible from task contexts.

This driver provides an in-kernel interface to those GPIOs using
platform-neutral GPIO calls.

can include temperature sensors, voltage sensors, fan speed
sensors and various additional features such as the ability to
control the speed of the fans.  If you want this support you
should say Y here and also to the specific driver(s) for your
sensors chip(s) below.

To find out which specific driver(s) you need, use the
sensors-detect script from the lm_sensors package.  Read

Hardware driver for the intel TCO timer based watchdog devices.
These drivers are included in the Intel 82801 I/O Controller
Hub family (from ICH0 up to ICH10) and in the Intel 63xxESB
controller hub.

The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) timer is a watchdog timer
that will reboot the machine after its second expiration. The
expiration time can be configured with the "heartbeat" parameter.

On some motherboards the driver may fail to reset the chipset's
NO_REBOOT flag which prevents the watchdog from rebooting the
machine. If this is the case you will get a kernel message like
"failed to reset NO_REBOOT flag, reboot disabled by hardware".

your system or have any real effect.  The only way to be sure
that this driver does what you want is to make sure you
are running it on an EPX-C3 from Winsystems with the watchdog
timer at IO address 0x1ee and 0x1ef.  It will write to both those
IO ports.  Basically, the assumption is made that if you compile
this driver into your kernel and/or load it as a module, that you
know what you are doing and that you are in fact running on an
EPX-C3 board!

This is the driver for the Berkshire Products PCI-PC Watchdog card.
This card simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
time. The card can also monitor the internal temperature of the PC.
More info is available at <http://www.berkprod.com/pci_pc_watchdog.htm>.

To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
module will be called pcwd_pci.

Most people will say N.

If you have a PCI-WDT500/501 watchdog board, say Y here, otherwise N.

If you have a PCI-WDT501 watchdog board then you can enable the
temperature sensor by setting the type parameter to 501.

If you want to enable the Fan Tachometer on the PCI-WDT501, then you
can do this via the tachometer parameter. Only do this if you have a
fan tachometer actually set up.
